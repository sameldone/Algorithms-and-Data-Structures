# Sorting Techniques

This directory contains implementations and comparisons of various sorting techniques. Below is a list of the sorting methods covered in this directory:

## Sorting Techniques

### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the sorted portion of the list.

### Selection Sort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it at the beginning.

### Quick Sort
Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

### Heap Sort
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a heap from the input array and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and puts it at the end.

### Merge Sort
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts the two halves independently, and then merges the sorted halves.

### Shell Sort
Shell sort is an optimization of insertion sort. It sorts elements that are far apart first, and then progressively reduces the gap between elements to be compared.

## Comparison of Sorting Methods
This section provides a comparative analysis of the sorting methods covered in this directory, including their time complexity, space complexity, and suitability for different scenarios.
